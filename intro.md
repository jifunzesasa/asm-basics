## What is Assembly Language?
A low-level assembly language is designed for a specific family of processors that represents various instructions in symbolic code and a more understandable form.


### Advantages of Assembly Language
Having an understanding of assembly language makes one aware of −

- How programs interface with OS, processor, and BIOS;
- How data is represented in memory and other external devices;
- How the processor accesses and executes instruction;
- How instructions access and process data;
- How a program accesses external devices.

### Other advantages of using assembly language are −

- It requires less memory and execution time;
- It allows hardware-specific complex jobs in an easier way;
- It is suitable for time-critical jobs;
- It is most suitable for writing interrupt service routines and other memory resident programs.
